    <h1>Shout out</h1>
    <p>Living for a day like I'm swept away everyday <br>
I got one small doubt <br>
I'm getting sick of all kinds of people's words<br>
Who on earth defines myself? <br>
The fake paradigm that locked me up <br>
Beyond the border line drawn by someone <br>
I shout out, and this is my shout out <br>
I'm all for myself <br>
