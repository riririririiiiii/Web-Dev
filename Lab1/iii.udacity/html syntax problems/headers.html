  <p>HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading.</p>
  <h1>The headers</h1>
  <h2>big important words</h2>
  <h3>subheading</h3>
  <h4>smaller heading</h4>
  <p>The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
